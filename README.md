three-mm3d
==========

A Misfit Model 3D format (.mm3d) loader for three.js. This is not based on .mm3d to .json converters. This code actually loads and parses the binary file itself.

See live demo at https://b391e55ae15b45d7ed9872931f9ef0e1f7e3541a.googledrive.com/host/0B9scOMN0JFaXY0ptc2haSTdZR3c/test.html

P.S.: This works only with three-r67 at most. The skeletal animation system was refactored and as of three-r68 this does not work anymore.
