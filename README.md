three-mm3d
==========

A Misfit Model 3D format (.mm3d) loader for three.js. This is not based on .mm3d to .json converters. This code actually loads and parses the binary file itself.

P.S.: demo-r68 is source code for the demo compatible with the latest three.js revision (r68). This is the demo linked above. Between r67 and r68, three.js's animation system was changed. For r67 compatible code, see demo-r67. Live demo for demo-r67 is here: https://b391e55ae15b45d7ed9872931f9ef0e1f7e3541a.googledrive.com/host/0B9scOMN0JFaXY0ptc2haSTdZR3c/test.html .
